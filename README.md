## How It Works

When enabled, this extension hides the HTML tags (`< >`) in your code editor, leaving behind a cleaner and more readable code layout. It's perfect for focusing on code structure or reading through code without distraction.

When disabled, it restores the HTML tags, making it easier to visually distinguish HTML elements.
